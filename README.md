# Demo consumers of coopnorge/cdk8slibrary

> Very POC
> Directory structure needs updating

## Requirements

* Have cdk8s cli installed

This example just consumes the library and fills variables using a struct

## Extended

This example adds an extra manifest (a job) to the chart. In the future also 
adding json patches should be supported.
